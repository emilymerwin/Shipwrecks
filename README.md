This is my first experiment with mapbox.js. The basemap is an example but it worked perfectly for this use. If it someday stops working, change the baselayer. 

I used this tool to convert my CSV to geojson: http://www.cparker15.com/code/utilities/csv-to-json/

Known issues:
The size of the images isn't calculated before the popups render, so the map offset isn't giving the taller ones enough space. Fix this.
